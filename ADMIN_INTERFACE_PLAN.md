Add an admin interface to manage site content such as pictures, text, and reviews. Implement authentication to secure the admin area.

## 2. Authentication System

- Backend:
  - Create login API endpoint.
  - Use session or JWT for authentication.
  - Protect admin API routes.

- Sections for managing:
  - Portfolio images and descriptions.
  - Services content.
  - Packages details.
  - Reviews and testimonials.
  - Contact inquiries.
- Use existing UI components where possible.
- Provide forms for CRUD operations.

## 4. Backend API
